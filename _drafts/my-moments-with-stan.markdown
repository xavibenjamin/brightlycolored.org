Stan Lee passed away yesterday at the age of 95.

I didn't know Stan personally, but his work permeates my life. I'm sure I don't even comprehend how much his work has influenced me. Brian Michael Bendis' tribute was my favorite, because from all accounts, Stan was a kind, optimistic, generous, and hilarious person. 

From my perspective, Stan stood for the less fortunate and the ones society deems odd. His smile and great sense of humor will be missed, but thankfully we haven't seen the last of him.
