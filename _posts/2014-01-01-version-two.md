With a fresh year, comes a fresh design. I had some serious issues with the previous version's typography, which I've mostly addressed with this redesign. It still needs refinement, but this is a good starting point for the year.

If you normally read in your RSS reader, take a look at the site today. I'd love to hear what you think.
