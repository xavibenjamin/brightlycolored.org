This past Friday, Kelly and I left our Minnesota home and embarked on a three-day road trip to Oceanside, CA. Oceanside will be our home for the next month as we try to get away from the cold and enjoy a working vacation of sorts just a few blocks away from the beach, and only a few minutes away from where I grew up.

Things will stay normal around here for the most part; I'll be writing as much as usual. I'm also working out here (the beauty of having a remote job). As you may already know, I'm on the tail end of a pretty rough depression, and I think all the sunshine and walks on the beach we've vowed to take will help a lot. Here are some pictures from yesterday's inaugural walk.
