Pretty small week for me, but great books I’m looking forward to! Here are my picks for the week.

- **X-23 #2**  
I was a big fan of [All-New Wolverine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-New_Wolverine). [Tom Taylor](https://twitter.com/TomTaylorMade) did an excellent job, and made both Laura and Gabby two of my all-time favorite characters. [Mariko Tamaki](https://twitter.com/marikotamaki) wrote a great first issue of this new series, and I’m looking forward to where she takes it.
- **The Amazing Spider-Man #2**  
I love Spidey as a character, and really enjoyed the first issue, especially the ending.
