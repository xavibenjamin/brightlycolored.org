[Dave Rupert on his personal blog](https://daverupert.com/2018/11/the-good-path/):

> I had a slew of vociferous tech industry blog posts queued up, but luckily I feel like caught myself going down a bad path(sic). I realized that wasn’t the kind of blogger I wanted to be. I realized that the people I admire most don’t *only* criticize technology they dislike. Rather, they amplify the things they enjoy. I want to be that type of person.

I had a similar realization. We get to decide what type of person we want to be. There's no shortage of negativity, cynicism, or much worse. But if this site is a reflection of *my personality*, <mark>I want that reflection to be filled with kindness, optimism, positivity, and the vast number of things I appreciate.</mark>
