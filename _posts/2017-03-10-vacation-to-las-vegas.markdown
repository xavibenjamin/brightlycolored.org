Dear Reader,

On Sunday, I'll be traveling to Las Vegas for a week. While we're in the area, we're going to visit the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, but most importantly, [In-N-Out](http://www.in-n-out.com/). For the uninitiated, In-N-Out is a magnificent place with burgers full of wonderfulness and deliciousness in every bite.

Regular posting will resume on March 20<sup>th</sup>. Have a great week!

🖖🏼
