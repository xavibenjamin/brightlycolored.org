Another Wednesday is here, which means it’s New Comic Book Day! Here are my thoughts on what I picked up last week, and what I’m picking up today.

## What I picked up last week

- **Captain America #2**  
This book definitely has a dark feel to it. Looks like Cap is going to be working through some issues. Not what I expected, but I liked it.
- **Immortal Hulk #4**  
So confused with this book. Everyone was raving about it, but I didn’t feel the same. Maybe I’ll pick it up in trade later.
- **Teen Titans #20**  
Not one copy left at my local comic shop. Bummer.

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #3**  
Spider-man is one of my favorite characters. Really intrigued to see where this is going.
- **Fantastic Four #1**  
The only comic I’ve read with the Fantastic Four is the original Civil War. I loved them. Looking forward to this series.
