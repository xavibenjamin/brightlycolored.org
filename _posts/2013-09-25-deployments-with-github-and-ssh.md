I had no idea that deployments could be this easy. Which surprises me, because I thought I had explored my deployment options. Kennedy was kind enough to make a video too.

Obviously this route is a bit nerdy, so if you want something that's managed for you, I recommend [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com/) or [Deploy](http://deployhq.com/).
