Tryouts this week! Only the best comics will survive the chopping block! Here’s what I *actually* ended up picking up last week, and what I’m planning on getting this week.

## What I read last week

- **X-23 #2**
- **The Amazing Spider-Man #2**
- **Mr. & Mrs. X #1**  
Decided to give this a try because I heard lots of buzz around the book. I ended up really liking it. Kelly Thompson did a great job with this first issue (those honeymoon panels were steamy!), and the ending left me very curious of what’ll happen next.

## Picking up this week

- **Captain America #2**  
Lots of buzz around this book, and I love Ta-Nehisi Coates. Let’s see what he’s doing with Cap.
- **Immortal Hulk #4**  
Again, lots of buzz around this book, so I’m giving a try. Hulk is one of my favorite characters.
- **Teen Titans #20**  
This book came out last week, and while I’ve never really been into *Teen Titans*, the team of characters looks fun.
