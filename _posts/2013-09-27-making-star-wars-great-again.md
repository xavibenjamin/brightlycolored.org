[Dave Mark on *The Loop*](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/27/dear-j-j-abrams-heres-how-to-make-star-wars-great-again/) regarding this video:

> This is just magical. I think Abrams should bring this guy on board as a technical advisor in charge of proper use of the force.

Agreed.

**Update on 12/20/2017 at 10:34am CST**: I fixed the broken video with the one that's working on YouTube. Also, I feel this video is applicable again after Rian Johnson's brilliant, *The Last Jedi*. Don't mess up Episode IX, J.J.
