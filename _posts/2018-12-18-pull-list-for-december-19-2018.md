Every Wednesday, new comic books hit the shelves with new stories to be engrossed in, and new art to be fascinated by. This is my weekly write-up where I share what comic books I read last week, and [my pull list](/topics/#pull-list) of comics for this week.

## What I read last week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #11** - Finally an issue I didn't really like. Is it Nick Spencer's fault? Not really. I just can't stand J. Jonah Jameson. Glad to have Ryan Ottley back on art though.
- **Batman Annual #3** - What a fantastic story. I make it a point to pick up almost anything Tom Taylor writes (haven't read his _Injustice_ comics though), and he didn't fail me. This heartwarming Alfred story brought a tear to my eye. The art was also superb and complimented the story perfectly.
- **Detective Comics #994** - What just happened here? While the initial solicit had me excited for this, the ending made no sense to me. Unfortunately, the issue leaves me more confused than intrigued. I won't be adding this to my pull list.
- **Miles Morales: Spider-Man #1** - Didn't enjoy this one much. The art wasn't great, and the issue doesn't get me excited for Miles as a character. Plus, with Tom Taylor's [_Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man_](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comics/series/139850/friendly-neighborhood-spider-man) coming out next month, I'll have more than enough Spidey to read.
- **Oblivion Song #10** - So Ed creates another transference and Nathan just forgives him by the end of the issue? What? I can't even begin to imagine the consequences of this event. As usual, Lorenzo De Felici draws a beautiful comic.
- **X-Men: Red #11** - Amazing finish to this series. I loved every moment of it. Jean Grey has never been better, and as I've seen some comment online, the team up between Gambit and Thor was perfect. I'm grateful to Tom Taylor for creating such a hopeful and inspiring series.

**Favorite of the week:** _Batman_ Annual #3

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #12** - How'd this happen? Back-to-back weeks of Spider-Man. _Hell yes_. I'm intrigued with this new Scorpion arc.
- **Aquaman #43** - Part of my "give DC a try" initiative. Kelly Sue DeConnick is legendary for her run on Captain Marvel, so we'll see if I like her take on Aquaman.
- **Catwoman #6** - Last issue I'll pull of this for now. I'm a big fan of the art, and Artgerm's variant covers have been wonderful, but the story has been mostly disappointing.
- **Cover #4** - This title keeps surprising me. The art is stunning, and the writing always leaves me thinking. Easily one of my favorite titles of the year.
