> BREAKING: LaVar Ball Launches League That Will Pay Top HS Prospects Up to $10K Per Month & Serve As An Alternative to College

Let me get this out of the way: [I don't like LaVar Ball](/2017/10/lavar-ball-fires-back-at-patrick-beverley-after-los-angeles-lakers-season-opener/). *However*, this feels like great news. The Ball family's utter disregard for the status quo might be beneficial for basketball players and other athletes.

This league would make sure players are paid to play instead of being exploited by the NCAA. It would radically reduce the one-and-done mentality—where players only play one season in college—and instead give them the financial security to grow and mature before entering the NBA.

Kudos to the Ball family for trying to effect change in a sports industry that needs it significantly.
