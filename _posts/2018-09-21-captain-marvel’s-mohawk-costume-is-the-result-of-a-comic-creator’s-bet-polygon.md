Kelly Sue DeConnick in an interview with Susan Polo for *Polygon*:

> “And so I called Jamie and was like, ‘Alright, I want you to make a bet with me. I bet if you do a Carol Danvers redesign for Captain Marvel that Marvel will buy the design from you. And if I win this bet, then I get a redesign and you get paid. And if I lose this bet, I will pay for the redesign.’”

Interesting story on Captain Marvel's new costume. I love the mohawk.
