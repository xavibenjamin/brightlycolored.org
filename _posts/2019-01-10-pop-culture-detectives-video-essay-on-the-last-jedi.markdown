There are many people (mostly men) on the internet that didn't like *The Last Jedi*. I think this video does a beautiful job of explaining why. *The Last Jedi* is constantly challenging masculinity, what it means to be a man, and what it means to be a hero.

And yes, just like any other film, there are always things that could be better. But the overall message of the movie is a positive one. It's one of inclusivity; it's one of equality. I hope [J. J. Abrams' "course correction" with Episode IX](/2018/11/jj-abrams-episode-ix-a-course-correction-after-dissapointing-box-office-numbers-for-solo/) follows that path.
