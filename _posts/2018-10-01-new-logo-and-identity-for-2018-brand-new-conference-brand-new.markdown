Armin Vit on *Brand New*:

> This year’s identity is based on a cliché but we liked where that cliché took us so we went with it: New York is a “Concrete Jungle”, ergo we are going to use concrete. This wasn’t conceived as a metaphor but as the literal, core ingredient through which we would standardize all the materials.

I don't think I've seen something like this before. They *literally* glued slabs of concrete as the cover of the programs. I can't even imagine the work involved in making these, but the execution is masterful.
