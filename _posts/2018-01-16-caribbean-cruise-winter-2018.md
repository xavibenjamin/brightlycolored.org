I'm back from our family cruise, and holy moly did that week go by quick! Eighteen members of my family and Kelly's went on this amazing cruise. I took my camera on the trip, so I'll share some of my favorite shots with you in the next few days.

I want to give a huge thank you to [TJ Draper](/authors/tjdraper/) for blog-sitting in my absence. He did an excellent job.

Now, back to work.
