[I've covered this before](https://brightlycolored.org/2017/01/displays-for-designers-and-developers-bjango/). It's been almost two years since then, and nothing much has changed. I figured display manufacturers would jump on the 5K and Thunderbolt 3 train, but
evidently not. Can't wait to see Apple's rumored display next year.
