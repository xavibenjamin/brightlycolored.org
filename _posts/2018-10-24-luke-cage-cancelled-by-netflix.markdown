Justin Carter writing for *CBR*:

> Another Netflix MCU series bites the dust, as Luke Cage will not be returning for a third season.

> The reason for the cancellation, supposedly, boils down to creative differences, though showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker had previously said he had plans for the series if it returned.

I'm shocked by this news. When [Netflix announced the cancellation of *Iron Fist*](https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/10/12/17971874/iron-fist-canceled-netflix), that made sense to me. The show didn't do well in its first season, and while the second season was a huge improvement, I'd think some didn't give it a second chance.

My hope is that this isn't the last we've seen of Luke Cage. He's a great character that was perfectly cast.
