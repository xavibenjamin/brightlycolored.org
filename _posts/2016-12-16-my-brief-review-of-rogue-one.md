_This review contains spoilers._

Kelly and I went to go watch _Rogue One_ on opening night. I purposely didn't read anything about the film, and was completely spoiler-free going in. Here are my thoughts, **that are full of spoilers**.

Seriously people, **spoilers**. You've been warned.

- It still felt like _Star Wars_ without the crawl.
- The score is ok. Michael Giacchino did a great job making it feel like _Star Wars_ within the time he had to do it.
- Understanding what the Death Star is made with was cool.
- I don't think we've visited so many places in one _Star Wars_ movie.
- Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are amazing in this movie.
- Vader. Oh my goodness. Vader, people. Vader. Vader.
- I wanted more Vader.
- James Earl Jones came back for Vader, and it was an awesome… 2 scenes 😭.
- This story adds so much context to _A New Hope_.
- Leia's motion capture face is _terrible_.
- The first two acts are a bit slow, and unfortunately don't use the time to give more information about the supporting characters.
- Everyone dies. _Everyone_. That was a surprise for me, but made sense.
- All in all, I really liked it, but _The Force Awakens_ is still my favorite of the recent _Star Wars_ movies.
