I know this trailer came out a while ago, but I just can't stop watching it! *Black Panther* looks, feels, and sounds very different to anything else we've seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The music used to score this trailer—and [the teaser](https://youtu.be/dxWvtMOGAhw)—are perfect and have me excited to hear the complete score and soundtrack.

*Black Panther* debuts on February 16, 2018 in the US. Get hyped.
