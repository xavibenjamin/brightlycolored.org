20th Century Fox's swan song is *Dark Phoenix*, the last X-Men movie they'll produce before the characters go back to Marvel Studios. I'm anxious to see Sophie Turner reprise her role as Jean Grey, since we didn't get to see her do much in *X-Men: Apocalypse*.

*X-Men: Days of Future Past* is probably my favorite X-Men film so far, and while I'll miss most of this cast (not you, Jennifer Lawrence), I can't wait for the X-Men to be part of the MCU. In [Kevin Feige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige) we trust!

If you'd like more information on what this movie is about, be sure to watch [Emergency Awesome's excellent video](https://youtu.be/loarJ7u3TN0).

*Dark Phoenix* debuts on June 7, 2019.

**Update on 09/28/2018 at 6:59pm CDT**: Updated release date after [Deadline reported the delay](https://deadline.com/2018/09/dark-phoenix-alita-battle-angel-deadpool-gambit-release-date-changes-1202473229/).
