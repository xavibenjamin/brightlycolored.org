FILM CRIT HULK:

> There’s a reason this movie begins with Luke throwing it off a cliff.
>
> In fact there’s a number of moments in the film that seem like direct refutations to the mystery box questions that were vaguely teased as maybe kinda sorta being deeply important. Why did we think they were? Because destiny! Because Skywalkers! Because Luke I am your father! Because mysteries and answers! And so for two years the internet does what they always do with J.J. and trying to solve the unsolvable questions that were never meant to be answered in the first place. So for two years they’ve been speculating about Rey’s parentage, or Snoke’s origins, or the Knights of Ren, etc. And what does the film do in response? It definitively takes those mystery box questions and throws them off the literal and proverbial cliff. Sometimes it’s done in a funny way, sometimes in an incredulous way, but it’s always in purposeful way(sic).

Rian Johnson's take on Star Wars is the best we've seen. Sure, I speculated about Rey's parentage, but Rian makes it clear it's not a mystery worth being interested in. Johnson instead helps us care about the parts of the story that do matter and redefines Star Wars for the better. A new Star Wars where not being a Skywalker doesn't mean you have no place in the story.
