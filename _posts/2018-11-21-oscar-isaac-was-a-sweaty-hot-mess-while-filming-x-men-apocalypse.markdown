[Renaldo Matadeen writing for *CBR*](https://www.cbr.com/oscar-isaac-hard-words-xmen-apocalypse/):

> Isaac revealed the costume and makeup effects needed to play the villain on-screen led to an "excruciating" experience, which feels similar to Jennifer Lawrence's past complaints about getting into costume to play Mystique over four X-Men movies.

> “Apocalypse, that was excruciating, " he said to [GQ](https://video.gq.com/watch/iconic-characters-oscar-isaac-breaks-down-his-most-iconic-characters). "I didn't know when I said yes that that was what was going to be happening. That I was going to be encased in glue, latex and a 40-pound suit — that I had to wear a cooling mechanism at all times."

Funnily enough, I was just telling a friend of mine that *X-Men: Apocalypse* is the only film I haven't liked Oscar Isaac in. After reading this, I completely understand why: he was miserable. Recreating Apocalypse’s look in a live-action film was always going to be difficult, but keeping Isaac away from the rest of the cast ended up showing in the performance.

If you feel like watching a film with a spectacular performance by Oscar Isaac, I recommend [*Operation Finale*](https://letterboxd.com/film/operation-finale/), which is a tense and thrilling story based on true events.
