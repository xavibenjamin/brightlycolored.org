> Almost eight years ago, Suz Hinton made one of the biggest decisions of her life: move away from her home in Melbourne, Australia and move to the United States. After amicably breaking up with her boyfriend, another decision lied ahead: would she stay?

I was so excited to talk with Suz. She's a wonderful person, and I loved hearing more of her story.
