Rachel Andrew:

> You won’t get far through a conversation about subgrid in CSS Grid Layout without someone suggesting that display: contents solves most of the problems anyway, so do we really need subgrid? This really isn’t the case, display: contents does indeed solve a class of problems, but these are different problems to those that subgrid would help us with.

Rachel Andrew explains in detail how `display: subgrid` is different to `display: contents`. Interestingly, I had a similar issue just the other day. In my situation however, `display: contents` would've worked perfectly. If you're trying to keep up to date with all the new layout stuff, this article is a must-read.
