Kevin Lanagin writing for *The Daily Planet*:

Kelly Thompson does a spectacular job of writing in Jessica's voice, so naturally I'm glad she's at the helm of this title. However, I wasn't too fond of this particular story arc. The characters involved weren't all that interesting by themselves, and unfortunately the plot of the arc is setup in several issues just to be resolved in a few panels. Considering I have that same critique for many Marvel titles, it would seem to be an editorial direction rather than the writer's decision.

All that being said, these are nitpicks. The book is fun, the art is fantastic, and the cameos are perfect. If Kelly Thompson keeps writing this title, I'll keep reading it.
