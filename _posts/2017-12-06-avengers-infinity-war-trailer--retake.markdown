Official episode description from NightOwl.fm:

> TJ and Tim are here as earth's mightiest heroes to avenge us all from infinity, or something like that. Join them to chat about the upcoming film 'Avengers: Infinity War' and its recently released trailer.

TJ and I got together last night to record two back-to-back episodes. The first of which is on the new trailer for *Avengers: Infinity War*. As you might imagine, we're both excited for this one.
