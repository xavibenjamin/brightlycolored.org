Rich Johnston for *Bleeding Cool*:

> DC Comics has informed comic book retailers that, as it stands, the sold-out-in-a-flash comic *Batman: Damned* #1 will not be reprinted. At all.

Though I didn't personally read this comic, I *obviously* saw pictures. You barely see enough to realize that Batman is packin'.

This all feels like an overreaction, really. It was clear the title is for adults so… I guess I don't see what the big deal is. But good news for those of you who own a copy, looks like you can make some good money.
