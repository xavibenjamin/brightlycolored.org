To be frank, this teaser doesn't do much for me. I worry that Han Solo is such an iconic character that those shoes are hard to fill—by any actor. The fact that it's February and they're barely starting to market this movie is also worrisome. I could be horribly wrong, but it's my belief that this film will prove to be a bad decision.

So far, Disney-led Star Wars has primarily focused on new characters, with some exceptions. Characters from the original trilogy have been played by the original actor. The problem with showing what Han Solo was like as a young man is that we've already seen Harrison Ford do it. Again, I could be horribly wrong, but I don't see how Alden Ehrenreich could possibly do young Han better.

Confusingly, I don't feel the same with the rumored Obi-Wan solo movie. Possibly because we never saw Alec Guiness play a young version, then have Ewan McGregor try it all over again. Both performances are spectacular, and I have no issues with seeing Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan.

But, don't get me wrong. I'll be seeing this movie either way. *Solo: A Star Wars Story* debuts on May 25<sup>th</sup>.
