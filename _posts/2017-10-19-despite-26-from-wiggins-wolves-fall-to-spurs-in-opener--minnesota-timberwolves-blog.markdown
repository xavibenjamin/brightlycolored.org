Kyle Ratke on the Minnesota Timberwolves Blog:

> The Wolves kept it close and it looked like they were turning a corner in the fourth quarter, but they fell to the Spurs in Wednesday’s season opener in San Antonio.

This was a tough first game. Not only did the Wolves start their season being away from home—they were in an arena where most teams lose. The Spurs are an excellent team even without Kawhi and Tony Parker on the floor. LaMarcus Aldridge apparently showed up to play scoring 25 points.

Wiggins, Towns, Teague and Crawford definitely did their part. I'd like to see more points from Jimmy Butler, and I'm sure that'll happen. But it's the first game of the season. There's a lot of games left, and plenty of time for the Wolves to iron out some of these kinks.
