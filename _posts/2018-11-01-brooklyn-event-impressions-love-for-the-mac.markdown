Jason Snell writing on his site *Six Colors*:

> This was the first time in four years since the Mac mini got love on stage, and that last update was completely underwhelming. This one’s *waaaaay* better. In fact, I have to say that it pretty much checked every box I wanted it to check. This is the Mac mini Apple should be making.

Interestingly, Jason had already said something similar when talking about the MacBook Air:

> This is the next-generation Air that I wished Apple had made in 2015.

To me, this is the key takeaway from the event. The announcements regarding the Mac felt like Apple is finally delivering on what we—the faithful Apple community—want. Sure, it's a couple years later than we wanted (fine, it's more like "many years"), but better late than never.

Instead of putting some self-imposed restriction to performance or I/O, Apple started the new Mac mini with four cores, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and replaceable RAM. The MacBook Air, instead of having just USB-C like the MacBook, has two Thunderbolt 3 ports that can drive 5K displays.

Tuesday's event felt different because it *was* different. Maybe… just maybe, <mark>we're finally being heard.</mark>
