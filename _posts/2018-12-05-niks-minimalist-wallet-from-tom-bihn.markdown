I bought myself [a new wallet from Tom Bihn](https://www.tombihn.com/products/minimalist-wallets?variant=13762313420863). Ever since I've had a wallet, it's always been some type of black leather. It was time to switch it up, so I went with the #3 in Dawn. Interestingly, I already had a minimalist wallet, but this one is even smaller.

If you're in the market for a new wallet, take a look at this one. Starting at \$24, you can't go wrong.
