Sam Stone writing for CBR on Marvel's post-credits scenes:

> For Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, this practice was an important one for him to include since the beginning as both a treat to fans and way to get audiences to stay and acknowledge the countless cast members that have helped make the MCU a reality.

> "Movies bring people together, but they also bring people together behind the scenes," explained Feige while accepting an award at BAFTA's 2018 Britannia Awards. "At Marvel Studios, we've been putting a scene after the end credits in all of our films since the very beginning. The fans love it; it's a tease of something to come. But the real bonus is that the audience is going to sit there and look at all the names of the hundreds of thousands of people who work so hard to bring these movies to life. That really inspired me as a kid, to see all those names, and I hope it inspires people today."

I had never thought about this, but I'm happier than ever to have stayed for all of these post-credits scenes. As you watch all the names go by, you realize the amount of work and coordination required to create a movie like this.

Another tidbit that stood out to me—as Sam Stone points out—is that fans have loved this practice so much that other studios have copied it.
