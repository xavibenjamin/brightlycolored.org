Jason Snell on *Macworld*:

> The Mac is a mature platform used by millions of people for work and play. The most important thing to do is keep the platform stable. Reduce bugs, remove security flaws, and keep everything running smoothly. The Mac thrives because it is recognizably the Mac. I don’t think it’s in anyone’s best interest—not Mac users, not the Mac platform’s overall health, and not Apple’s strategic goals—for Apple to invest energy in a rethink of macOS to turn it into something it’s not.

This is the most important thing I want from Apple in 2018. Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to see what they do with the Mac Pro and a possible external display. But [Apple's rollout of High Sierra has been problematic](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16727238/apple-macos-ios-software-problems-updates) to say the least. I know many who haven't upgraded, myself included.

If WWDC came and Apple said the next version of macOS had no new features, only bug fixes, I'd be *really happy*. As Jason rightly points out, caring about the Mac means making macOS as stable and secure as possible. The rollout of High Sierra makes me feel like Apple forgets how much we depend on the Mac to get our work done.

macOS is the best desktop operating system out there, but the gap will continue to close if Apple doesn't stop being so sloppy.
