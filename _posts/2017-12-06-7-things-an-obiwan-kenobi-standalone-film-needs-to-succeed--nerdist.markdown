Eric Diaz on *Nerdist*:

> So what can an Obi-Wan movie tell us about the character that six movies didn’t tell us? Well, keep in mind all those films were about Obi-Wan’s relationship to his fallen apprentice Anakin Skywalker. A solo film entirely divorced from the whole Darth Vader situation would be the perfect vehicle to explore who Obi-Wan Kenobi really is outside of the context of his relationship to his former padawan.

Even though this article is riddled with typos and grammatical errors, it's still worth the read if you're in the mood to infer what the writer was trying to communicate. I'm excited to see a movie tell the story of Obi-Wan. While I understand that Anakin Skywalker was a big part of his life, I agree with the article in him being excluded from this movie. We know very little of Obi-Wan's beginnings, the work involved in learning to become a force ghost after death, and much more.
