Dear Reader,

Just wanted to let you know that I redesigned the site over the weekend. I'm calling it Version `4.0.0`, but it's probably more of a `3.5.0`. This site has gone through so many iterations over the years, that a lot of the bones stay exactly the same, just the aesthetics change.

Anyway, if you normally read from your RSS reader, click through and take a look. Let me know what you think.
