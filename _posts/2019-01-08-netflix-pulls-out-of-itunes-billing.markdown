[Yet another example](/2016/07/spotify-says-apple-wont-approve-a-new-version-of-its-app-because-it-doesnt-want-competition-for-apple-music-recode/) of how users suffer when companies have petty arguments. In the end, Netflix still tells people to sign up by going to the site; they just end up understanding that information in a huge waste of time. This stupidity is unnecessary.
