Mara H. Gottfried for the *Pioneer Press*:
 
> A 19-year-old female passenger in a vehicle was seriously injured in a Sunday afternoon shooting in St. Paul, police said.
>
> The shooting occurred in Frogtown, the neighborhood where two people were killed in separate shootings early Saturday and Sunday. Police said the homicides appear unrelated, as does the shooting that injured the woman on Sunday about 2:30 p.m.

I was about 300 feet away from this shooting. First time I witness a gun shot quite as close. Scary stuff.
