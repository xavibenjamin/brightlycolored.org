For a while now, I've been feeling like the name *The Bold Report* was too official for what I'd been writing. I'd always meant it ironically[^ironically], but I never felt like it come off that way. The logo was pretty bad too, with the word "Bold" in bold… real subtle Tim.

So I started thinking of a new name. I started writing down words that sounded like "me". I even asked a few friends what words they thought of when thinking of me. I got some interesting responses.

Then, suddenly, like a opossum in the night, it came to me: *Brightly Colored*. If you know me in person, you'll know that I'm constantly wearing bright colors. It's a staple of my fashion sense. You'll see me wear yellow shorts, bright-patterned socks, and shoes of all colors.

This name speaks to so much more than just what I wear, but I don't want to bore you with the details. Just like *The Bold Report*, you'll find my musings on a whole range of different things. I've brought over all of the archives, and I (hopefully) redirected all the RSS feeds. If you're subscribed to the email newsletter, you don't need to change anything either.

I'd love to hear what you think of the new site and name! As always, [you can find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/smithtimmytim) or [send me an email](mailto:tim@brightlycolored.org). Thank you for all your support.

[^ironically]: Much like The Colbert Report was.
