Mina Markham on *Several People Are Coding*:

> In August, we released a major redesign of slack.com, and we want to give you a peek behind-the-scenes. Rebuilding our marketing website was a massive project that took careful coordination across a variety of teams, departments, and agencies.
> 
> We implemented a redesign while overhauling all the under-the-hood code. Our aim was to address a few goals at the same time: deliver a consistent rebranded experience while tackling critical improvements to site architecture, code modularity, and overall performance and accessibility.

This is one of those amazing posts that reminds me how much I still need to learn. You can tell that alongside Mina, there are many smart people working on Slack.com.
