## What I read last week

- **Analog Vol. 1 Trade Paperback**  
  Read this book in one sitting and loved it. <mark>Gerry Duggan writes some great dialogue and his commentary on the internet is spot on.</mark> Also, the paper this is printed on is beautiful and feels wonderful as you turn each page.
- **Dead Rabbit #1**  
  I'll be honest, I bought this because I couldn't pass the cover up. It's so nice in fact, I framed it and hung it up on my wall. The story was good too (another one from Gerry Duggan), but I didn't connect enough with it to pull future issues.

**Favorite of the week:** Analog Vol. 1 Trade Paperback

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #7**  
  This is the best single-issue comic I'm picking up right now. Nick Spencer is doing a great job with this story. Not loving Humberto Ramos' art, but it's by no means terrible.
- **Catwoman #4**  
  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Joëlle Jones is amazing. Both her art and writing on this arc has been fun to read. Those Artgerm variants are beautiful too.
- **X-23 #5**  
  Mariko Tamaki's run on _X-23_ has been a great transition from Tom Taylor's _[All-New Wolverine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-New_Wolverine)_. Last month's issue didn't advance the plot much, so I'm hoping this one has a little more substance.
