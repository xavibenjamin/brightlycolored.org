Wednesday is here again, and that means it’s new comic book day! I don’t have any books on my pull list coming out this week, but that doesn’t mean I’m not reading something. Here’s my review on what I read last week, and what I’m reading this week.

## What I picked up last week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #3**  
Loving this Spider-man run! It comes with the humor you expect from a Spider-man title, and the internal emotional turmoil that is classic Peter. I’ve read some say the arc is similar to other stories in the past, but since I haven’t read those, I’m enjoying it.
- **Fantastic Four #1**  
Great return for the FF! There are a few things that I feel you needed to know before reading (which I think shouldn’t be the case in a #1), but the end of this issue had a tear in my eye.
- **Catwoman #1 & #2**  
I was intrigued to hear [Joëlle Jones](https://mobile.twitter.com/joelle_jones) was not only writing, but also responsible for the art inside. I’m relatively new to comics, so I hadn’t seen that done before. Also, [Artgerm](https://mobile.twitter.com/artgerm) created [awesome variant covers](https://www.thetim.blog/2018/08/12/loved-issue-and.html). I’m so glad I picked these books up! The story looks to be an interesting one, and Joëlle’s art is unique and expressive.

## Reading this week

- **Batgirl: Stephanie Brown Vol. 1**  
[One of my favorite AMSR videos](https://youtu.be/Nl1GsUFa6cE) talks extensively about the Stephanie Brown run of Batgirl. She talks so well of the run, I finally had to pick it up! I’m about a quarter way in, and very much enjoying the story!
