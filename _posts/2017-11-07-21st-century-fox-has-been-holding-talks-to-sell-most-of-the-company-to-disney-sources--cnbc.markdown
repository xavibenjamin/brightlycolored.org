David Faber for CNBC:

> 21st Century Fox has been holding talks to sell most of the company to Walt Disney Co., leaving behind a media company tightly focused on news and sports, according to people familiar with the situation.

Holy moly. Really trying to keep my composure and not get crazy excited about what this would mean. But let's have a little fun. Imagine the Fantastic Four and X-Men being part of Marvel Studios. Marvel will finally be able to drop the façade of loving the Inhumans.[^inhumans] 

I don't know what would happen to Deadpool—or any other R-rated comic book film that Fox had in the pipeline for that matter. My gut says Disney would try those films at a PG-13 rating. I don't think Ryan Reynolds would do anymore if that were the case. Personally, I think it would be foolish of Disney to kid-ify[^kidify] certain properties. The reality is not all comic books are for kids. What they've done with the different Netflix Series gives me hope that they understand this.

Also, as [Cinema Blend explains](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1722280/how-a-fox-and-disney-merger-could-directly-affect-star-war), this could be great news for Star Wars fans too. It could mean that we get a pre-special edition version of the original trilogy without having to pirate it.[^it] Imagine that! We've been trying to give Fox our money, but they just don't want it!

But, we're totally getting ahead of ourselves here. It's only a rumor. A rumor, I'd be interested in becoming reality.

[^inhumans]: I kid. The Inhumans are pretty cool, but Marvel has tried to make them into the X-Men unsuccessfully. Kevin Feige didn't want to do a movie about them, so they got downgraded to a TV Show… which bombed. The newer comics of the Inhumans give them very similar traits to the X-Men. Oh and the Fantastic Four don't even have a comic book right now.

[^it]: Did I say that? Fox, I would never pirate a film of yours that used to be better before George Lucas got his gruby hands on it. Never.

[^kidify]: That's a word… right? Right?
