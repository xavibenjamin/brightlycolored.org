Shawn Blanc speaking truth on *The Sweet Setup*:

> To be candid, carrying a camera with me has never—ever—felt convenient. I’ve been shooting with a mirrorless kit of some sort since [late 2012](https://shawnblanc.net/2012/11/olympus-e-pl5-first-impressions/), and even after all these years I still feel silly walking around with my camera over my shoulder and taking photos in public. I continually have to make the decision that, yes, I am bringing the nice camera with me.

I agree. Taking the camera is always a conscious decision for me, and the days where I leave without it, I end up regretting it. 

Currently, my workflow involves Lightroom Classic CC on the Mac, but I think it's becoming a bit cumbersome, so I may try going the VSCO route like Shawn.
