From NBA.com

> Los Angeles Lakers rookie guard Lonzo Ball had a quiet statistical start to his NBA career last night, finishing with three points (on 1-for-6 shooting), nine rebounds, four assists, a steal, a block and two turnovers in a 108-92 home loss to the LA Clippers. A good portion of Ball's struggles could be attributed to the job Clippers point guard Patrick Beverley, a noted defensive stalwart, did in guarding him.

The sports media went crazy [saying that Lonzo wasn't worth the hype](https://youtu.be/dB9ebWKUDl8) after his first game in the league. *One game*. If that's not ridiculous, I don't know what is. What's funny is [the very next night](http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/171020-postgame-wrap-lakers-suns) Lonzo had 29 points, 11 rebounds and 9 assists in a win against the Suns.

But let's be real here. This isn't about Lonzo Ball. This is about LaVar Ball. LaVar is a moron who cowardly talks trash on behalf of his son. Many players are now gunning for Lonzo because of the idiotic comments of his father. Why would a father do this to his son? Why would he write checks that Lonzo shouldn't be expected to cash?

Yes, LaVar Ball undoubtedly created a lot of hype around his son and they got what they wanted—being picked by the Lakers—but now it's time to shut up and let the kid play. He's a great player and is only going to get better. Let the numbers speak for themselves, and if anyone's going to talk trash, let it be Lonzo.
