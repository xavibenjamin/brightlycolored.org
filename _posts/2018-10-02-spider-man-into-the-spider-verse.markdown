As much as I love live-action Spider-Man, I'm really excited about this. The movie looks funny and action packed, yet have some pretty great character moments too. Oh and [the cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Into_the_Spider-Verse#Cast)! Holy moly!

*Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* debuts on December 14, 2018.
