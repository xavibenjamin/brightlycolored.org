Zac Hall for *9to5Mac*:

> Scott Killian never imagined his Apple Watch might save his life, but that’s exactly what happened a few weeks ago when he had a heart attack in the middle of the night.
>
> …
> 
> His Apple Watch charted his heart rate at around 121 beats per minute in the middle of the night while data previously captured showed his average resting heart rate at around 49 beats per minute. The data also showed that this was the first time his resting heart rate had reached this level since he began wearing Apple Watch, so he decided to go to the emergency room as a precaution.
>
>…
>
> Then the hospital took a blood test and discovered an elevated enzyme that signals a heart attack has occurred or is occurring. Further testing revealed four blocked arteries which required the insertion of four stents (inflated titanium carbon fiber sleeves) to correct.

As a person with anxiety and hypochondria, I can't tell you how much this story freaks me out. The article says that Scott had "thousands of dollars of tests" to rule out the possibility of a heart attack, and then he gets one. 

My anxiety aside, this article shows how insanely helpful the tiny device I wear on my wrist can be. I remember watching [Big Hero 6](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245084/) and thinking how cool it would be to have a robot do a health scan on you. Little did a I think that the Apple Watch is capable of doing some important health scans now, and will do more in the future. This is technology at its best—warning us about potential health dangers, and in extreme situations, saving our life like it did with Scott.
