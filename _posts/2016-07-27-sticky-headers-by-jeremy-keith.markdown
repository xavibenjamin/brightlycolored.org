>I made a little tweak to [The Session](https://thesession.org/) today. The navigation bar across the top is “sticky” now—it doesn’t scroll with the rest of the content.
>
> I made sure that the stickiness only kicks in if the screen is both wide and tall enough to warrant it. [Vertical media queries](https://boagworld.com/dev/vertical-media-queries/) are your friend!
