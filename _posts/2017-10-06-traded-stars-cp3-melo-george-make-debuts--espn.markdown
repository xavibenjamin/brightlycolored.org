Tim MacMahon and Royce Young writing for *ESPN*:

> A fresh era officially started for three of the NBA's stars on Tuesday night at Tulsa's BOK Center, as [Carmelo Anthony](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony), [Paul George](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george) and [Chris Paul](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul) made their preseason debuts for their new teams following offseason trades.
>
> Those three were the headliners in the [Houston Rockets](http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets)' 104-97 victory over the [Oklahoma City Thunder](http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder).

The Rockets were dropping threes like they were going out of style. They're going to be a difficult matchup for a lot of teams.[^teams] One thing was for sure, Chris Paul and James Harden looked a lot more acquainted with each other than Paul George and Melo did. It's obvious the Thunder need more time to build chemistry. 

[^teams]: Although it sometimes feels like everyone shoots from the three in the NBA nowadays.
